# DK Web Design Redesign

**This repo is only a copy of the private repo that was used to build the site**

This repo is used to show potential employers a recent project that I built for DK Web Design. This site is live and can be seen [here](https://www.dkwebdesign.com/).

## Technologies
This project was built using several web technologies:
* HTML 
* CSS/SCSS
* PHP
* JavaScript, mainly the Interactive Employee Module found on [this page](https://www.dkwebdesign.com/about.php). Make sure to check out the custom script in js/employee-module.js.
* Foundation 6
* NPM/Bower/Gulp
