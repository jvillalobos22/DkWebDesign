                        <p>A template website (also referred to as a theme) is a pre-designed webpage that we purchase a license to. We than drop in your text content, photos, colors, and logo in order to make it visually represent your business. With a template, "what you see is what you get". Think of it like moving into a rental house; you can paint the walls and arrange the furniture to your liking, but you can't add on rooms or knock out walls.</p>

                        <p>A custom website is designed specifically for your business based on your goals. The sky is truly the limit with a custom website as we can include any necessary features to get your desired result. You will be in the loop every step of the way, approving our ideas before we execute them.
